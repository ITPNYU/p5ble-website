We had our first [p5 BLE workshop](https://itp.nyu.edu/camp2019/session/55) at ITP Camp 2019 this summer!

## p5.ble.js 101: Bluetooth Communication between Arduino and p5.js

Check out the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qkzMBh1A0eyD_W9J3G1VoI08VGDkVDUKFC5-pi1aUbc/edit?usp=sharing) to learn more about Bluetooth LE concepts and p5.ble. 

This is a hands-on workshop to get started with [p5.ble.js](https://itpnyu.github.io/p5ble-website/), a library that enables communication between Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices and p5 sketches. 

The in-class example will be using Arduino MKR1010 to interact with a p5.js sketch. Please bring your laptop, an Arduino MKR1010, a micro-USB cable and a breadboard to this workshop. You could check out Arduino MKR1010 from the shop if you don't have one. If you are using a new MacBook, please also bring a USB-C to USB adaptor.
